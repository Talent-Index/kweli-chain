# ðŸš€ Kwelichain â€“ Blockchain-Powered KYC and Certificate Verification

Kwelichain is a decentralized certificate verification system built for Africa.
It solves the problem of fake IDs, degrees, and certificates by offering a trustless, affordable, and secure verification layer for institutions, employers, and individuals.

---

##  Why Kwelichain?
- Fake certificates & IDs are rising with powerful AI tools.  
- Western solutions (Persona, Veriff) are expensive & not tailored for Africa.  
- Kwelichain provides a **local-first alternative**: fast, transparent, and built on Avalanche.

---

##  Features
- Upload and hash certificates (degrees, IDs, licenses).

- Store proofs on blockchain (Curvegrid MultiBaas + Avalanche).

- Verify authenticity instantly via blockchain.

- Responsive, modern UI (React + Tailwind).

- Smart contract deployment handled via Hardhat + OpenZeppelin.

- Full-stack: Frontend (Vite + React) + Backend (Node.js/Express) + Blockchain (Solidity).
